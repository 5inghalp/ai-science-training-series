# Introduction to Deep Learning


This tutorial covers the basics of Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Nets. The tutorial is broken into three notebooks. The topics covered in each notebook are:

1. **Intro.ipynb**: 

      - *Linear Regression* as _single layer, single neuron model_ to motivate the introduction of Neural Networks as Universal Approximators that are modeled as collections of neurons connected in an acyclic graph
      - _Convolutions_ and examples of simple _image filters_ to motivate the construction of _Convolutionlal Neural Networks._
      - Loss/Error functions, Gradient Decent, Backpropagation, etc

2. **Mnist.ipynb**: 

    - Visualizing Data
    - Constructing simple Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Training and Inference
    - Visualizing/Interpreting trained Neural Nets

3. **CIFAR-10.ipynb**: 

    - Data Generators
    - Overfitting
    - Data Augmentation



## Environment Setup

Start by cloning the git repository with this folder. If you are using ALCF, see our [previous tutorial's instructions.](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series/blob/main/00_introToAlcf/02_howToSetupEnvironment.md#git-repo)

From a terminal run the following commands:

```
ssh username@theta.alcf.anl.gov
```
```
git clone https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series.git
```

After cloning, move into the repo directory, load the `conda/2021-09-22` module and run the following commands to download the data we will be working with:
1. `cd ai-science-training-series/02_deepLearning/ `
2. `module load conda/2021-09-22`
3. ``` 
   python << EOF  
   from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist 
   mnist.load_data()
   EOF
   ```


### ALCF Jupyter-Hub

You can run the notebooks of this session on ALCF's Jupyter-Hub. 

1. [Log in to a ThetaGPU compute node via Jupyter-Hub](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series/blob/main/00_introToAlcf/04_jupyterNotebooks.md)

2. Change the notebook's kernel to `conda/2021-09-22` (you may need to change kernel each time you open a notebook for the first time):

    1. select *Kernel* in the menu bar
    1. select *Change kernel...*
    1. select *conda/2021-09-22* from the drop-down menu
