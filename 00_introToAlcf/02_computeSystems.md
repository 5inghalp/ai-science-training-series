# Cluster/HPC Computing Hardware Setup

In large supercomputers, like Theta, you combine multiple computer processors (CPUs) and/or graphics processors (GPUs) into a single _node_. A _node_ is like your desktop computer. It has a CPU on which the local operating system runs. It has local memory for running software. It may have GPUs for doing intensive calculations. Each node has a high-speed network connection that allows it to communicate with other nodes and to a large shared filesystem.

Large systems typically have _worker_ nodes and _login_ nodes. _login_ nodes are the nodes on which every user arrives when they login to the system. _login_ nodes should not be used for computation, but for compiling code, writing/editing code, and launching _jobs_ on the system. A _job_ is the application that will be launched on the _worker_ nodes of the supercomputer.
