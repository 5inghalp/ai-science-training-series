 # Generative Models

In this session, we'll learn about Generative models, particularly Auto Encoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.  Generally, "generative" models refer to models that can do a unique task: look at a dataset, and synthesize a new item that is similar to the items already in the dataset.

The difficulties to this, though, are many.  You don't have "new" images for a dataset to directly compare against, so these networks typically fall under the "Unsupervised Learning" category.  There isn't a definitive answer as to what is a new data point so it is a challenging problem.

We'll learn in this session some introductory techniques for generative models, as well as application examples.
