# Introduction to Machine Learning

Week 2 of our AI for Science tutorial series focuses is on machine learning, starting on the classic methods and fundamental techniques.

The corresponding notebooks to the lecture focus on first learning how to use Scikit-Learn, a widely-used machine learning package in Python, 
and then illustrate how to use it with scientific data that requires pre-processing, using molecular property prediction as an example.

## Environment Setup

We provide two different environments that can run the provided notebooks.

### ALCF Jupyter

**TO ADD FILIPPO's INSTRUCTIONS HERE**

### Local Installation

The `environment.yml` file provided with this README describes how to build the environment with anaconda.

Once you have anaconda installed, build the environment by calling:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

from the command line. Once installed, follow the instructions Anaconda generates to activate the environment and then launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
